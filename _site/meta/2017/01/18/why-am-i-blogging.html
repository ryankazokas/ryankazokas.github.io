<p>For anyone that knows me, knows I have a technical background. I have very little writing experience outside of a few poorly written papers in college and some technical requirements’ documents. One of the main reasons I decided to take up this hobby is not only to improve my writing skill but to share my experiences, thoughts, and decisions from my point of view, in an interesting manner.</p>

<p>As I write more blog posts, I am learning that writing is expressing my thoughts clearly. It is definitely a challenge for someone that doesn’t write a lot. So in this endeavor I will attempt to write posts that are clear and convey a sense of meaning. The end goal will not be to please others, but to please myself with things that interest me. However, hopefully  I can interest and teach people a little about myself and how I interpret topics.</p>

<p>The inspiration came from an article I read from codinghorror’s website:
<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/fear-of-writing/">
Fear of writing</a></p>

<p>“CodingHorror” is run by one of the most influential entrepreneurs in the software community: Jeff Atwood. Atwood is the creator of Stack Overflow and Discord products, and was also my introduction into the blogging world.</p>

<p>Thanks to anyone who may find enjoyment in reading my posts in the future. Please just keep in the back of your mind, that I am slowly learning this new craft!</p>
