<h1 class="title">Reflecting on a Software Engineering Master's Degree</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p><strong>The Decision</strong></p>

<p>The age old question of whether or not one should advance on to graduate school and if it is worth the time/money will always be subjective. It depends on the context of the situation that the person is in. There are a slew of questions to ask oneself when considering graduate school.  Working a job as a front end developer, doing mostly graphic design, I found myself at a job that wasn’t fulfilling my aspirations of becoming a full stack developer.  My decision to go  to graduate school stemmed from my desire to be more technically knowledgeable. The decision came about when talking to my wife(then girlfriend at the time) at a small diner over breakfast. Discussing issues at my current job and how I wasn’t 100% happy, I mentioned that I was considering it, and she persuaded me that it would open me up for other opportunities. I couldn’t thank her for being more right. My mind was set, I was going to go for my masters degree in software engineering.</p>

<p>My undergraduate degree was a Bachelors of Science in Information Systems and Technology. For people outside of the technology community, IST is more of on the side of using/developing technology for businesses than it is “engineering”. Applying for a software engineering masters degree with a background like mine was very intimidating. Most things I knew about engineering was self taught for things that I needed to know for personal projects outside of school. One thing I knew applying to the program was that I was going from undergraduate Penn State to graduate Penn State, so the people reviewing my application would know the exact curriculum that I had in undergrad, so I took comfort in that thought.  Low and behold, after a few weeks of anticipation I was notified of my acceptance into the program.</p>

<p><strong>The First Day</strong></p>

<p>The feeling of getting into a graduate school program was thrilling.   The sense of accomplishment was surreal, however it was time to get serious. The first day was upon us, and everyone attending as a “freshman” was part of a cohort. (cohort 12 to be exact) This meant that every single person you start with, you will finish the program with, which in my opinion is a great idea, especially in the online environment. There was a required preliminary course that everyone in the cohort had to attend. We were introduced to the other students, about 30 of us, just engaging in conversion on discussion boards of where we live, what we do, what were interested in, etc. With the fear that this would be like undergrad where we had to spend the first day of each course getting to know each other and exchanging information, I was very apprehensive in my expectations for the rest of the program, however due to us being a part of the cohort this was not necessary. It was just in the “ground breaking” part of the program.</p>

<p><strong>What I learned</strong></p>

<p>When our actual classes started up, we jumped right into it. Requirements engineering was my first course. Needless to say, it didn’t sound very interesting. Why do I have to know requirements? The business owners should know that. This was my first lesson. User stories, scrum, and other methodologies were taught in the course. It wasn’t the technical lessons that caused me to have a revelation, but the consideration for any and all parts of software development. It showed me how to pay attention to detail. I realized how much forethought had to go into software outside of just coding. Throughout the program I learned about various software processes, and how they are applicable to industry. The most important thing I took from it was the attention to detail and the appreciation for design, architecting, refactoring, and constructing systems.</p>

<p><strong>Worth It?</strong></p>

<p>There will always be that argument that industry experience will trump academia. However, when I received the offer from my current job I absolutely think that showed my current employer that I was willing to learn and go the extra mile to know what I need to know. Over time I think the degree will lose some of it’s value just because of the fact that industry experience is more important as you climb the ladder.(No matter what position/field you are in). As a personal achievement, it was 100% worth it. Having that foundation of knowledge to base my actual work on is fantastic. It helps me if not on an daily basis, a weekly basis. I am always using and applying what I learned from the program in my day to day work.  Overall, even with the stress that comes with working 8 hours, driving 2 hours every day, and coming home to do 3 hours of homework every night, I would do it again. I met some great knowledgeable people and made lifetime connections.</p>
