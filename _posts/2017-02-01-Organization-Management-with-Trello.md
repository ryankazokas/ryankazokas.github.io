In the past, I have tried many tools to keep organized. To list some I've tried keeping small memo pads, whiteboards, software like todoist and Google tasks (all great tools), but I couldn't stick with any of them. The problem seemed to stem from one day of not using whatever flavor of organization tool I was stuck on at the time. Neglect would snowball and before I realized, the task list was old and outdated. It was very frustrating because it left me unorganized and forgetting things I had to do.

Around 2 years ago, I had came across a Reddit post from a user that was inquiring about bug tracking software. The top comment at the time was a link to Trello. They have a blog with different ways you can utilize Trello and it seemed very versatile. There wasn't a singular way to organize, which I found very intriguing, I created an account and haven't looked back since.

I started using it by creating a board for work. I categorized my different work projects and miscellaneous tasks into their own cards. This helped me because I was able to differentiate tasks into groups but still have them in a single place. Here is an example of how I use my board at work:

It is different than the normal to do where you might do the high level categorization of "work" things todo, but it stops there.

I keep my personal boards simple, to avoid clutter and bad organization. My personal board resembles this:

Recently, Trello has made it so that you can use one "power up" per board if you don't have the business version of the product. Trello integrates with outside services like github right onto your boards, which is a great feature if you want to couple Trello with external resources. I have no experience integrating with outside parties within my Trello boards but it's great that Trello sees itself as more than just a simple todo application.
