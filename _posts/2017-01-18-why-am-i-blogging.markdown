For anyone that knows me, knows I have a technical background. I have very little writing experience outside of a few poorly written papers in college and some technical requirements documents. One of the main reasons I decided to take up this hobby is not only to improve my writing skill but to share my experiences, thoughts, and decisions in how I feel is an interesting manner.

As I write more blog posts, I am learning that writing is expressing my thoughts clearly. It is definitely a challenge for someone that doesn't write a lot. So in this endeavor I will attempt to write posts that are clear and convey a sense of meaning. 

The inspiration came from an article I read from codinghorror's website:

Fear of writing](https://blog.codinghorror.com/fear-of-writing/)

CodingHorror is run by one of the most influential entrepreneurs in the software community, Jeff Atwood. Atwood is the creator of Stack Overflow and Discord products, and my favorite blog to follow.
