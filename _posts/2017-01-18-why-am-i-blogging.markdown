For anyone that knows me, knows I have a technical background. I have very little writing experience outside of a few poorly written papers in college and some technical requirements documents. One of the main reasons I decided to take up this hobby is not only to improve my writing skill but to share my experiences, thoughts, and decisions in how I feel is an interesting manner.
