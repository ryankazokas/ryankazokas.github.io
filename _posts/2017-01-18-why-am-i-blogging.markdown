For anyone that knows me, knows I have a technical background. I have very little writing experience outside of a few poorly written papers in college and some technical requirements documents. One of the main reasons I decided to take up this hobby is not only to improve my writing skill but to share my experiences, thoughts, and decisions in how I feel is an interesting manner.

As I write more, I am learning that writing is expressing my thoughts clearly. It is definitely a challenge for someone that doesn't write a lot. So in this endeavor I will attempt to write posts that make sense and convey a sense of meaning.
