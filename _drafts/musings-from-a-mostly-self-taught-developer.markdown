Let me preface this post by stating that I do have a formal education. I actually have a master's degree in Software Engineering and a Bachelor's degree in Information Sciences. However, I do, for the most part, claim to be self-taught. This post will explain my explanation for this claim as well as my thoughts and trials throughout.

One thing that bugs me about college students is that most of them think that a college is a place that you will learn everything. That the degree they get at the end is the golden ticket to get a job wherever they want. But the way college charges you, what else would you expect? You have to pay for it somehow, right? My feeling is that the students attending college just learn whatever is spat out in 1-hour lectures, pointless unchecked homework assignments, and the ever 'important', end of semester finals. Wrong.

College is what YOU make of it. Without wanting to learn something, without wanting to be a part of a community of people that have the same interest as you, you aren't going to get the result that you would expect out of college.
