My name is Ryan Kazokas. I live and work in the Scranton/Wilkes Barre area at TMG Health.  I specialize in java software development
but my expertise skills have a range that extends to C#, javascript, among other languages, working in frameworks such as Spring, Hibernate, and MyBatis.
Striving for personal and professional excellence, I spend a lot of time improving my skills to become the best person and the best professional software engineer I can be.

For my education, I obtained my bachelors degree from the Pennsylvania State University in Information Sciences and Technology. I have also received a Master's of Software Engineering
from the Pennsylvania State University in the Summer of 2016.
