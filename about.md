My name is Ryan Kazokas. I live and work in the Scranton/Wilkes Barre area at TMG Health.  I specialize in java software development
but my expertise skills have a range that extends to C#, javascript, among other languages, working in frameworks such as Spring, Hibernate, MyBatis, Reactjs, and node.
Striving for personal and professional excellence, I spend a lot of time improving my skills to become the best person and the best professional software engineer I can be. I try to stay up on and evaluate current and emerging technologies to be used in my personal and work projects.

For my education, I obtained my bachelors degree from the Pennsylvania State University in Information Sciences and Technology. I have also received a Master's of Software Engineering
from the Pennsylvania State University in the Summer of 2016.

I have a wife(Sam), daughter(Auden), and a new born son(Cooper) as of December 2016. I am more than thrilled to be part of all of their lives. 
They are the most important things in my life and always will be.(Software is a close second!)
